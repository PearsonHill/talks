# talks

We want YOU to come talk or present at a future charmCityJS event! (Seriously, we want you to do it. We'll beg if we have to.) A "talk" can be anything--a walk-through of some code you wrote, a story you want to tell, a project you're working on, some art or a robot or a song or wearable tech or anything you can think of that even remotely relates to JavaScript or the tech community in general, we're all ears!

Talks should be 1-20 minutes long, and our events occur on the first Wednesday of the month starting May 2015 in Baltimore, MD. View our [meetup.com page](http://www.meetup.com/charmcityjs) for a list of upcoming events.

**To submit an idea**, just [create a new issue](https://github.com/charmCityJs/talks/issues/new) and fill it out with your details. Just casually give us an idea of what you'll talk about and how long it'll be. **OK GO!!!**

> _Note: If you'd prefer not to use GitHub for any reason, you can also submit talks via this Google Form: http://goo.gl/forms/gBCRtIiyMH_
