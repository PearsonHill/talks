# talks

We want YOU to come talk or present at a future charmCityJS event! (_Seriously, we want you to do it. We'll beg if we have to._) A "talk" can be anything:

- a walk-through of some code you wrote
- a story you want to tell
- a project you're working on
- a story about some art you played around with
- a story about a robot you met/made
- a story about a song you made a computer co-create
- a story about some wearable tech you think is cool
- anything you can think of that even remotely relates to JavaScript or the tech community in general!

Talks must be less than 20 minutes long for us to consider them, with 5-10 minute talks being our preference. Our events occur on the first Wednesday of the month--check out our [meetup.com page](http://www.meetup.com/charmcityjs) for a list of upcoming events.

**To submit an idea**, just [create a new issue](https://github.com/charmCityJs/talks/issues/new) and fill it out with your details. Just casually give us an idea of what you'll talk about and how long it'll be. **OK GO!!!**

> _Note: If you'd prefer not to use GitHub for any reason, you can also submit talks via this Google Form: http://goo.gl/forms/gBCRtIiyMH_
